# 🎨 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A Python-based graphical application that visualizes the step-by-step execution of common sorting algorithms. This tool is designed to enhance understanding of algorithmic behavior through interactive animations, making it ideal for students, educators, and developers.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages the `tkinter` library to provide an intuitive GUI for visualizing sorting processes. Users can input the number of elements to sort, generate a randomized dataset, and observe how different algorithms sort the data in real time.

---

## ✨ Features

- Visual representation of:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Customizable number of elements (bars)
- Dynamic animation to illustrate sorting steps
- Highlights:
  - Minimum value
  - Maximum value
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Built entirely with standard Python libraries

---

## 🖥️ User Interface

When the application is launched:
- A welcome screen introduces the tool
- The user is prompted to enter the number of bars to sort
- The main interface includes:
  - Shuffle button
  - Buttons to select a sorting algorithm
  - A visual canvas showing sorting animation
